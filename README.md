# NLP

###### Thesis: Can I read in a text file or some text and then provide information about the text i.e Word, count, words used, comparison against most frequently used words. etc. Maybe then suggest type of text, and then with some significance level determine if a work was written by the same author. etc

###### Natural Language Processing: 
My interest in natural language processing was sparked by watching a TV show where an expert guessed the educational level of a ransom note author by analyzing the text's punctuation, capitalization, and grammar. I have since learned to use various Python packages and libraries to perform tasks of interest to businesses:

- Insight generation from customer feedback: I reviewed a fashion website's customer responses, 23 million total. Using spacy, NLTK and a few other libraries and models. I classified it by sentiment and complexity. Generating more datasets that can be used for further analysis.
